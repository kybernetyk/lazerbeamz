A Swfit warpper for Philips Hue HTTP API. Licensed under Affero GPL 3.

##Current Status

Stuff works. Still playing around with it. Contains some weird toy testing code (like changing the room lighting according to the current desktop wallpaper).

##Warning

Will crash if your desktop wallpaper is not in a RGB color space (black & white for example). Also will probably crash if you don't have randomized wallpapers enabled. 

Have fun!
